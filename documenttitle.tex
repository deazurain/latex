% Defines a macro \documenttitle that reflecs the title of the document set with \title{}
% This is required because the internal \@title cannot be used after \maketitle has been issued
% It does not matter if you use \title{} before or after this definition
% \documenttitle will obviously only be available after you used \title{}
